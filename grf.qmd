title: The Matérn Covariance Function
---
The Matérn covariance between measurements taken at two points separated by $\rho = \|x - y\|$ distance units is given by
$$
C(x,y) = \sigma  \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)} \left( \frac{\rho}{\lambda} \right)^{\nu}K_{\nu} \left( \frac{\rho}{\lambda} \right) ,
$$ {#eq-matern}
where  $\Gamma$ is the gamma function, $K_{\nu }$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, $\lambda$ (correlation length) and 
$\nu$ (smoothness) are positive parameters of the covariance.

@fig-grfraster gives examples of the Matérn function for different values of correlation length and smoothness.

When the GRF is evaluated to generate the prior ensemble, the correlaton length and smoothness parameters are being kept fixed.

We note further, that the choice of the Matérn parameters should refelct the a priori knowledge about the spatial features of the model.

Finally, we emphasize the **Invariance Subspace** property which states, that the EKI results tend to converge towards a model which lies in the span of the initial EKI ensemble.
