For the numerical experiments, we consider a half-space with an embedded conductive anomaly generated from a realization of a Mat√©rn-type Gaussian Random Field (GRF).

First, a GRF realization is computed on a pre-defined, sufficiently dense tensor-product grid. Next, the resulting grid values are mapped onto a zeroth-order finite element (FE) space, enabling straightforward evaluation during a higher-order FE assembly step. By staying within the FE framework, we can seamlessly interpolate this continuous function onto the desired piecewise constant parameter of the partial differential equation (PDE).

A detailed view into the resulting model is depicted in @fig-true. Note that the actual computational domain extends to $\pm 30$ km in both vertical and horizontal directions.

In the following sections, we demonstrate the impact of the correlation length $\lambda$ and the smoothness parameter $\nu$ (as defined in @eq-matern) on the inversion results.

All images represent the sequence of Kalman ensemble means as returned from a single iteration step.

The animations display the model updates along with the corresponding normalized data misfit for each iteration.
