This website contains supplementary material to my poster about "Parallel Ensemble-Kalman-Inversion using Gaussian Random Fields" presented at the [26th EM Induction Workshop, Beppu, Japan, 2024](https://www.emiw.org/emiw2024/).
:::

This study presents a parallel implementation of the Ensemble-Kalman-Inversion (EKI) algorithm (@iglesias2013, @iglesias2016,  @muir2020), tailored for 2-D magnetotelluric (MT) inversion. We employ Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) for effective parametrization of the electrical conductivity.
In our numerical approach we utilized the Julia Finite Element package `Gridap.jl` (@badia2020) which ensures accurate mapping of GRFs onto the Finite Element (FE) space. 
Furthermore, we customized the `Gridap.jl` package to meet the specific requirements of 2-D MT modeling, resulting in the development of `GridapMT.jl`.
